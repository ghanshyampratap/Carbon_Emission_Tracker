## 💡 Our Project – Carbon Emission Tracking & Forest Guardian 🌍🌳

We tackled two critical global challenges:

### 🔥 Carbon Emissions: 
- Quantifying emissions from vehicles to mitigate global warming.

### 🌲 Deforestation: 
- Detecting tree logging and forest fires in real time to protect ecosystems.

## ✅ How It Works:

### 📊 **Data Collection**:
- **Sensors Used:**
  - **MQ135** - Detects smoke and harmful gases.
  - **DHT11** - Measures temperature & humidity.
  - **GY-521 Gyroscope** - Detects changes in angle to identify tree falls.
  - **NEO-6M GPS** - Provides real-time location coordinates.

### 🧐 **Detection & Analysis**:
- Real-time sensor data is used to calculate carbon emissions.
- Abnormal angle changes detected by the gyroscope help identify illegal logging.

### 🚨 **Alert System**:
- Authorities receive **real-time notifications** for immediate action using the **CallMeBot API**.

### 📈 **Data Visualization**:
- Logged sensor data is analyzed and presented in reports to aid sustainable practices and policymaking.
